# Addect (Under Development)

A basic Android game built using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)and MVVM pattern with the [Android Data Binding Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html). It also uses [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency Injection. 

This project is heavily based on [Patrick LÃ¶wenstein's](https://github.com/patloew) sample repository [Countries Architecture](https://github.com/patloew/countries) and structured by [Tushar Acharya](https://github.com/tushar-acharya)

The purpose of this is app is to show how:
* the MVVM pattern can be used with the Data Binding using Kotlin
* Databinding can be used
* Dagger 2 can be used with Kotlin and Mvvm structure
